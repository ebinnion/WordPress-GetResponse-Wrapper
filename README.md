GetResponse-PHP-Wrapper
=======================

This project was forked from the GetResponse PHP Wrapper project to allow for better operation in WordPress, specifically to use the WordPress HTTP API. It is the intention that this project build upon the work done by GetResponse, Robert, and Shashank in order to provide better integration with core WordPress functionality.

This project was forked from the PHPWrapper hosted by GetResponse, which is no longer being supported.

It includes patches to work with the new GetResponse API and additional methods.
